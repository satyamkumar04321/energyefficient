Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm in Quantum OS

Quantum Operating Systems (QOS) are designed to leverage quantum computing capabilities, requiring efficient resource management to maximize computational efficiency. Traditional CPU scheduling algorithms are often inadequate for quantum environments due to differences in computation paradigms and energy constraints. This project introduces a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes energy efficiency in a quantum computing context, reducing power wastage and optimizing execution time..

Goal:
The goal of this project is to design an energy-efficient CPU scheduling algorithm for Quantum OS that reduces power consumption while ensuring optimal system performance. The algorithm will focus on efficiently allocating resources between quantum and classical tasks, utilizing quantum parallelism, and adapting to different quantum hardware to improve energy efficiency without compromising computational effectiveness.
